		The Dasein Persistence Libraries provide data access tools that 
		support the development of database applications. For simple database
		applications, automated persistence tools like Hibernate are definitely
		the way to go. Where the database is your performance constraint or where
		you are faced with legacy or complex data models, however, automated
		persistence often falls apart.

		This package supports a variety of functionality, including:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Database-independent sequence generation.</li>
		<li>Transaction management.</li>
		<li>Implementation of the classic memento pattern.</li>
	</ul>
